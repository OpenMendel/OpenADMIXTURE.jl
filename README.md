# OpenADMIXTURE.jl
[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-dev-blue.svg)](https://OpenMendel.github.io/OpenADMIXTURE.jl/dev)

This software package is an open-source Julia reimplementation of the [ADMIXTURE](https://dalexander.github.io/admixture/) package. It estimates ancestry with maximum-likelihood method for a large SNP genotype datasets, where individuals are assumed to be unrelated. The input is binary PLINK 1 BED-formatted file (`.bed`). Also, you will need an idea of $K$, the number of ancestral populations. If the number of SNPs is too large, you may choose to run on a subset of SNPs selected by their information content, using the [sparse K-means via feature ranking](https://github.com/kose-y/SKFR.jl) (SKFR) method.

With more efficient multi-threading scheme, it is 8 times faster than the original software on a 16-threaded machine. It also supports computation on an Nvidia CUDA GPU. By directly using the data format of the PLINK BED file, the memory usage is 16x-32x smaller than using `Float32` or `Float64` type.

## Installation

This package requires Julia v1.9 or later, which can be obtained from
<https://julialang.org/downloads/> or by building Julia from the sources in the
<https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia> repository.

The package can be installed by running the following code:
```julia
using Pkg
pkg"add https://github.com/kose-y/SKFR.jl"
pkg"add https://github.com/OpenMendel/OpenADMIXTURE.jl"
```
For running the examples in our documentation, the following are also necessary. 
```julia
pkg"add SnpArrays CSV DelimitedFiles"
```

For GPU support, an Nvidia GPU is required. Also, the following package has to be installed:
```julia
pkg"add CUDA"
```
